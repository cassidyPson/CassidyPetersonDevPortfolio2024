TITLE:
Cassidy Peterson's Online Portfolio

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This is a repository containing the source code for my personal portfolio.

The project is intended to give some background information about myself as a developer,
to provide some of my development projects for anyone potentially interested in working with me
and to view to learn more about me and my abilities as a developer.

The website layout began from a template that I recreated through following a step by step
guide. Then I began slowly changing it over time to create my own unique version of it.

The first screen is a landing page which also contains a link to my LinkedIn profile page,
please feel free to connect with me there as well.

Further down the page I used CSS and made use of a free icons library to create a custom
services section. Here I've listed some of the services that I offer as a developer and
also in other areas of digital production.

Then I have a projects section displaying some of my development work with direct links to
their online locations where users can try them.
